            I have at least 3 years working in different roles and different
            projects, specializing in React with NodeJs. Throughout my
            professional career I have built apps in Odoo, WordPress, Angular,
            Ionic, but my self-education has always been focused on learning
            React. Below you will find some of my main projects built in React.
